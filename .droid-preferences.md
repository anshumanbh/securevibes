# Droid Workflow Preferences

This file documents workflow preferences for AI assistants (Droid/Claude) working on this codebase.

## Git Workflow

### Staging and Committing

**STOP POINT: After `git add`**

When making changes, Droid should:
1. ✅ Make changes (create, edit, delete files)
2. ✅ Stage changes with `git add <files>`
3. 🛑 **STOP HERE** - Inform me that files are staged
4. ⏸️ Wait for me to review and commit manually

**I will then:**
- Run `git status` to see staged files
- Run `git diff --cached` to review changes
- Write and execute my own commit message
- Push manually when ready

**Droid should NEVER:**
- ❌ Run `git commit` (unless explicitly requested)
- ❌ Run `git push` (unless explicitly requested)
- ❌ Commit without showing me what's staged first

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Droid does:
git add file1.py file2.md

# Then stops and tells me:
"✅ Files staged: file1.py, file2.md"
"Run 'git status' to review before committing."

# I do:
git status
git diff --cached
git commit -m "my message"
git push origin main
```

## Code Changes

### Always Update Together

When changing code, **always update in the same change:**
- ✅ Code implementation
- ✅ Tests for the code
- ✅ Documentation (docstrings, README, etc.)
- ✅ Remove docs for deleted features

**Never:**
- ❌ Update code without updating tests
- ❌ Delete features without removing docs
- ❌ Batch documentation updates separately

---

## Testing

### Before Declaring "Done"

Always verify changes work by:
1. ✅ Running relevant tests (`pytest`)
2. ✅ Checking for import errors
3. ✅ Verifying examples in docs still work

---

## Documentation

### Keep Docs Accurate

- ✅ Remove references to deleted commands/flags immediately
- ✅ Update examples when API changes
- ✅ Verify all code examples actually run
- ✅ Update both root README and packages/core/README together

---

## Communication Style

### When Presenting Work

- ✅ Be concise (1-4 sentences summaries)
- ✅ Show what changed, not verbose explanations
- ✅ List files modified/created/deleted
- ✅ Indicate when stopped (after git add, before commit)

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Checks

Periodically suggest (don't do automatically):
- Dead code detection
- Test coverage reports
- Documentation audits
- Dependency updates

See `docs/MAINTENANCE.md` for full maintenance guide.
