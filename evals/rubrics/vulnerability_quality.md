# Vulnerability Finding Quality Rubric

Use this rubric to evaluate the quality of individual vulnerability findings from SecureVibes.

## Scoring Scale (1-5)

### 5 - Excellent

The vulnerability finding demonstrates comprehensive security analysis:

- **Clear Title**: Specific, actionable title that identifies the vulnerability type and context
- **Detailed Description**: Explains the vulnerability, why it's dangerous, and the attack vector
- **Precise Location**: Exact file path and line number(s) where the vulnerability exists
- **Concrete Evidence**: Code snippet showing the actual vulnerable code pattern
- **Exploitability Assessment**: Realistic assessment of how exploitable the issue is
- **Actionable Remediation**: Specific fix recommendation with code example tailored to this codebase
- **Correct Classification**: Appropriate CWE ID and severity level

### 4 - Good

The finding is useful and mostly complete:

- Title correctly identifies the vulnerability type
- Description explains the core issue
- File location provided, line number may be approximate
- Code snippet present and relevant
- Reasonable severity assessment
- Recommendation present, may be somewhat generic

### 3 - Adequate

The finding identifies a real issue but lacks detail:

- Title is accurate but generic
- Description is brief or missing context
- File path present, line number may be missing
- Code snippet may be incomplete or missing
- Severity may be over/under-estimated
- Recommendation is generic/boilerplate

### 2 - Poor

The finding has significant quality issues:

- Vague or misleading title
- Description doesn't clearly explain the vulnerability
- Location information incomplete or incorrect
- Missing code evidence
- Wrong severity level
- Generic recommendation that doesn't address the specific issue

### 1 - Fail

The finding should not have been reported:

- False positive (secure code flagged as vulnerable)
- Wrong vulnerability type identified
- Critical information completely missing
- Completely incorrect severity (e.g., INFO for SQL injection)
- No actionable information provided

## Specific Assertions to Check

When grading, verify:

1. **The vulnerability type is correctly identified** - Is this actually the claimed vulnerability?
2. **The code snippet shows the problem** - Does it demonstrate the vulnerable pattern?
3. **The recommendation is specific** - Does it apply to this codebase, not generic advice?
4. **The severity is justified** - Does it match the actual risk?
5. **The CWE ID is correct** - Does it match the vulnerability type?

## Common Deductions

- -1 point: Generic "validate all inputs" recommendation instead of specific fix
- -1 point: Missing code snippet when one should be provided
- -1 point: Severity over-inflated (e.g., CRITICAL for low-impact issue)
- -2 points: Wrong vulnerability type in title
- -2 points: False positive (secure code flagged)
