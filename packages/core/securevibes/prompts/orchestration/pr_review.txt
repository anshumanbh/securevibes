Perform a context-aware PR security review.

PHASE: PR CODE REVIEW
- Announce: "Starting PR Code Review"
- Use the Task tool to invoke the 'pr-code-review' agent to analyze the diff
- The agent reads context in this order:
  1) Prompt-provided changed files and changed-line anchors (authoritative diff context)
  2) Prompt-provided threat + vulnerability summaries
  3) Prompt-provided security-adjacent file hints
  4) Actual changed and adjacent source files via Read/Grep
  5) .securevibes/DIFF_CONTEXT.json only as optional backup context
- The agent writes .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json with its findings
- Report: "PR code review complete" when done

CRITICAL RULES:
- The 'pr-code-review' agent is already defined. Use the Task tool to invoke it.
- The orchestrator must not write files; only the pr-code-review agent may write .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json.
- Execute ONLY the pr-code-review agent (no other phases).
- WAIT for the agent to complete before finishing.
- VERIFY PR_VULNERABILITIES.json exists after completion.
- Keep responses brief - focus on invoking the agent and reporting completion.
