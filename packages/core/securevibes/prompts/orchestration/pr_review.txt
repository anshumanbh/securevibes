Perform a context-aware PR security review.

PHASE: PR CODE REVIEW
- Announce: "Starting PR Code Review"
- Use the Task tool to invoke the 'pr-code-review' agent to analyze the diff
- The agent reads .securevibes/DIFF_CONTEXT.json, SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json
- The agent reads .securevibes/VULNERABILITIES.json if present (for deduplication)
- The agent writes .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json with its findings
- Report: "PR code review complete" when done

CRITICAL RULES:
- The 'pr-code-review' agent is already defined. Use the Task tool to invoke it.
- The orchestrator must not write files; only the pr-code-review agent may write .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json.
- Execute ONLY the pr-code-review agent (no other phases).
- WAIT for the agent to complete before finishing.
- VERIFY PR_VULNERABILITIES.json exists after completion.
- Keep responses brief - focus on invoking the agent and reporting completion.
