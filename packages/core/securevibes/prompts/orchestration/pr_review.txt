Perform a context-aware PR security review.

PHASE: PR CODE REVIEW
- Announce: "Starting PR Code Review"
- Use the 'pr-code-review' agent to analyze the diff
- Reads .securevibes/DIFF_CONTEXT.json, SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json
- Reads .securevibes/VULNERABILITIES.json if present (dedupe)
- Creates .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json
- Report: "PR code review complete" when done

CRITICAL RULES:
- Execute ONLY the pr-code-review agent (no other phases)
- WAIT for completion before finishing
- VERIFY PR_VULNERABILITIES.json exists after completion
- Do NOT delegate work to other agents via Task tool
- Keep responses brief - focus on invoking the agent and reporting completion
