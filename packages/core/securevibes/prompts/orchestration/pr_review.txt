Perform a context-aware PR security review.

PHASE: PR CODE REVIEW
- Announce: "Starting PR Code Review"
- Invoke the EXISTING 'pr-code-review' agent (it is already defined - do NOT create any files)
- The agent reads .securevibes/DIFF_CONTEXT.json, SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json
- The agent reads .securevibes/VULNERABILITIES.json if present (for deduplication)
- The agent writes .securevibes/PR_VULNERABILITIES.json with its findings
- Report: "PR code review complete" when done

CRITICAL RULES:
- The 'pr-code-review' agent ALREADY EXISTS in the system. You invoke it; you do NOT create it.
- Do NOT write any files yourself. The agent writes PR_VULNERABILITIES.json.
- Do NOT create, modify, or write any files in the target repository.
- Execute ONLY the pr-code-review agent (no other phases)
- WAIT for completion before finishing.
- VERIFY PR_VULNERABILITIES.json exists after completion.
- Do NOT delegate work to other agents via Task tool
- Keep responses brief - focus on invoking the agent and reporting completion
