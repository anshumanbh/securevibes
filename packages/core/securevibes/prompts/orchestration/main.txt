Perform a complete security analysis of this codebase.

EXECUTION MODE CHECK:
- Check if environment variable RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set
- If RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set, run ONLY that sub-agent and skip all others
- Check if environment variable SKIP_SUBAGENTS is set  
- If SKIP_SUBAGENTS is set (comma-separated list), skip those sub-agents
- Otherwise, execute all phases sequentially

Execute these phases SEQUENTIALLY, ONE AT A TIME:

PHASE 1: ASSESSMENT
- Skip if: SKIP_SUBAGENTS contains "assessment" OR (RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set AND != "assessment")
- Announce: "Starting Phase 1: Assessment"
- Use the 'assessment' agent to analyze architecture
- Creates .securevibes/SECURITY.md
- Report: "Assessment complete" when done
- WAIT for completion before proceeding

PHASE 2: THREAT MODELING
- Skip if: SKIP_SUBAGENTS contains "threat-modeling" OR (RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set AND != "threat-modeling")
- Announce: "Starting Phase 2: Threat Modeling"
- Use the 'threat-modeling' agent to search for threat patterns using STRIDE
- Reads .securevibes/SECURITY.md
- Creates .securevibes/THREAT_MODEL.json
- Report: "Threat modeling complete" when done (do NOT include threat counts - counts will be calculated from the file)
- WAIT for completion before proceeding

PHASE 3: CODE REVIEW
- Skip if: SKIP_SUBAGENTS contains "code-review" OR (RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set AND != "code-review")
- Announce: "Starting Phase 3: Code Review"
- Use the 'code-review' agent to validate threats with evidence
- Reads .securevibes/THREAT_MODEL.json
- Creates .securevibes/VULNERABILITIES.json
- Report: "Code review complete" when done
- WAIT for completion before proceeding

PHASE 4: REPORT GENERATION
- Skip if: SKIP_SUBAGENTS contains "report-generator" OR (RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set AND != "report-generator")
- Announce: "Starting Phase 4: Report Generation"
- Use the 'report-generator' agent for final report
- Reads SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json, VULNERABILITIES.json
- Creates .securevibes/scan_results.json with ALL vulnerabilities
- Report: "Report generation complete" when done
- WAIT for completion before proceeding

PHASE 5: DAST VALIDATION (CONDITIONAL)
- Skip if: DAST_ENABLED != "true" OR SKIP_SUBAGENTS contains "dast" OR (RUN_ONLY_SUBAGENT is set AND != "dast")
- Check environment variable DAST_ENABLED
- If DAST_ENABLED != "true", SKIP this phase entirely
- If DAST_ENABLED == "true":
  - Announce: "Starting Phase 5: DAST Validation"
  - Use the 'dast' agent to validate vulnerabilities via HTTP-based dynamic testing
  - Reads .securevibes/VULNERABILITIES.json
  - Creates .securevibes/DAST_VALIDATION.json
  - Agent may use skills discovered in .claude/skills/dast/
  - Report: "DAST validation complete" when done

CRITICAL RULES:
- Execute agents ONE AT A TIME in strict sequential order
- Explicitly announce each phase before starting
- WAIT for each phase to complete before starting the next
- VERIFY the required artifact exists after each phase. If missing, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
- Do NOT delegate work to other agents via Task tool
- Each agent uses ONLY its assigned tools
- Phase 5 is OPTIONAL - only run if DAST_ENABLED=true

Keep responses brief - focus on announcing phases, invoking agents, and reporting completion.
