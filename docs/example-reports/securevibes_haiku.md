## Detailed Findings

### 1. AI Agents Running with bypassPermissions Grants Unrestricted Filesystem Access [🔴 CRITICAL]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:294`  
**CWE:** CWE-250  
**Severity:** 🔴 Critical

**Description:**

The Scanner class explicitly configures ClaudeSDKClient with permission_mode='bypassPermissions' at line 294, granting all AI agents unrestricted Read/Write access to the entire filesystem without user prompts or containment. This bypasses normal permission checks and allows agents to read sensitive system files (/etc/passwd, ~/.ssh/, browser credentials) and write to arbitrary locations, potentially enabling privilege escalation if an agent behaves maliciously or is manipulated through prompt injection. The bypassPermissions mode provides zero containment beyond OS-level user permissions.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
            agents=SECUREVIBES_AGENTS,
            cwd=str(repo),
            max_turns=config.get_max_turns(),
            permission_mode='bypassPermissions',
            model=self.model,
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Change permission_mode to `default` or `acceptEdits` to require user confirmation for sensitive operations.
2. Implement filesystem sandboxing in pre_tool_hook by validating all file paths are within repository boundary using `os.path.realpath()` and checking resolved path starts with repo path.
3. Add `SECUREVIBES_RESTRICT_FILESYSTEM` environment variable to enforce strict mode.
4. Whitelist allowed file paths based on repository root.
5. Add audit logging for all Read/Write operations with full path disclosure.

---

### 2. Symlink Attack Allows Writing Outside Repository Boundaries [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:242`  
**CWE:** CWE-59  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

The .securevibes/ directory creation at scanner.py:242 uses securevibes_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True) without validating that the path is not a symbolic link before writing artifacts. An attacker who creates .securevibes/ as a symlink to a sensitive location (e.g., ~/.ssh/, /etc/, /var/www/) can cause the scanner to follow the symlink and overwrite critical files with scan artifacts (SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json, VULNERABILITIES.json, scan_results.json). Combined with bypassPermissions mode, this enables silent privilege escalation attacks.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        # Ensure .securevibes directory exists
        securevibes_dir = repo / SECUREVIBES_DIR
        try:
            securevibes_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to create output directory {securevibes_dir}: {e}")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement symlink detection before creating directory: if `securevibes_dir.is_symlink()`: raise SecurityError('Output directory is a symlink').
2. Use `os.path.realpath()` to resolve symlinks and verify resolved path is within repository: if not realpath(securevibes_dir).startswith(realpath(repo)): raise `SecurityError()`.
3. Validate all file paths before writing in pre_tool_hook ensuring no component is a symlink.
4. Add --no-follow-symlinks flag (enabled by default).
5. Set securevibes_dir permissions to 0700 after creation.

### 3. API Key Exposure Through Environment Variables and Process Memory [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/config.py:40`  
**CWE:** CWE-522  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is accessed from environment variables by the ClaudeSDKClient without any secure credential storage. Environment variables are visible to all processes running as the same user via 'ps aux e', /proc/PID/environ, and core dumps. The API key persists in plaintext in process memory throughout scan execution. No memory protection (mlock), OS keyring integration, or automatic redaction in logs is implemented. Test files confirm authentication relies on environment variable inheritance (test_cli.py:198).

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    @classmethod
    def get_agent_model(cls, agent_name: str) -> str:
        env_var = f"SECUREVIBES_{agent_name.upper()}_MODEL"
        return os.getenv(env_var, cls.DEFAULTS.get(agent_name, "haiku"))
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Integrate OS keyring (keyring library) for secure credential storage.
2. Implement memory protection for API keys using `mlock()` or secure memory allocators.
3. Add automatic redaction of API keys in all log output and error messages.
4. Support short-lived session tokens instead of long-lived API keys.
5. Implement API key rotation mechanism.
6. Warn users about environment variable visibility in documentation.
7. Clear sensitive environment variables after initial read.

---

### 4. Sensitive Vulnerability Reports Stored in Plaintext Without Encryption [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/reporters/json_reporter.py:24`  
**CWE:** CWE-311  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

All scan artifacts (SECURITY.md, THREAT_MODEL.json, VULNERABILITIES.json, scan_results.json) are written to .securevibes/ directory as plaintext files with standard file permissions (0644 default). These files contain detailed vulnerability information including exploitation techniques, exact file paths with line numbers, code snippets that may contain hardcoded secrets, and attack scenarios. No encryption, access controls, or secure deletion is implemented. Files persist indefinitely with no expiration policy.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    @staticmethod
    def save(result: ScanResult, output_path: Union[str, Path]) -> None:
        output_file = Path(output_path)
        output_file.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(result.to_dict(), f, indent=2)
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement AES-256 encryption for all artifacts in .securevibes/ with user-provided or derived encryption keys.
2. Add secure deletion functionality using shred or multiple overwrite passes.
3. Implement automatic expiration policy deleting artifacts after 30 days.
4. Set restrictive file permissions (0600) on all output files.
5. Warn users prominently about artifact sensitivity during scan.
6. Provide --encrypt flag for sensitive environments.

---

### 5. Compromised PyPI Package Could Execute Malicious Code During Installation [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/pyproject.toml:29`  
**CWE:** CWE-494  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

SecureVibes and its critical dependency claude-agent-sdk are distributed via PyPI without hash verification or package signing. The pyproject.toml specifies flexible version ranges (claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0) allowing automatic updates to potentially compromised versions. No pip --require-hashes mode is used. An attacker who compromises PyPI infrastructure or maintainer accounts could distribute malicious packages executing arbitrary code during 'pip install securevibes'.

**Code Snippet:**

```
dependencies = [
    "claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0",
    "anyio>=4.0.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
    "click>=8.0.0",
    "rich>=13.0.0",
]
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Pin exact dependency versions with cryptographic hashes in requirements.txt: 'claude-agent-sdk==0.1.1 --hash sha256:...'.
2. Use pip's --require-hashes mode for installation verification.
3. Implement package signing with GPG keys.
4. Enable PyPI two-factor authentication (2FA) on maintainer accounts.
5. Add CI/CD pipeline checks scanning dependencies with pip-audit or safety.
6. Document supply chain security recommendations.

### 6. AI Agent Output Files Can Be Modified Without Detection [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:369`  
**CWE:** CWE-353  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

Files created by AI agents lack integrity protection mechanisms such as cryptographic signatures, HMAC, or checksums. An attacker with filesystem write access can modify VULNERABILITIES.json to remove critical findings, inject false vulnerabilities, or manipulate scan results without detection. Sequential agents (threat-modeling, code-review, report-generator) trust previous agent outputs without verification. No tamper detection exists when loading artifacts.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        if results_file.exists():
            try:
                with open(results_file) as f:
                    results_data = json.load(f)
                
                issues_data = results_data.get("issues") or results_data.get("vulnerabilities")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement `HMAC`-`SHA256` signatures for all artifacts using a scan-session secret key.
2. Verify signatures before parsing any artifact file.
3. Add tamper-evident logging with timestamps and file hashes.
4. Store artifact checksums in a separate integrity manifest file.
5. Implement secure audit trail tracking all file modifications.
6. Add visual indicators in reports showing verification status.

---

### 7. Scanning Large Repositories Causes Uncontrolled API Cost and Resource Exhaustion [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:249`  
**CWE:** CWE-400  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

No pre-scan size estimation, cost budgeting, or spending caps exist before initiating scans. Users can unknowingly scan massive repositories triggering thousands of API calls and incurring significant costs. The only limit is SECUREVIBES_MAX_TURNS (default 50, configurable via environment variable) which can be set arbitrarily high. No file count limits, file size limits, or cost thresholds prevent scanning of multi-gigabyte repositories. Progress tracking shows costs but does not enforce limits.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        # Count files for reporting
        files_scanned = len(list(repo.glob('**/*.py'))) + len(list(repo.glob('**/*.ts'))) + \
                       len(list(repo.glob('**/*.js'))) + len(list(repo.glob('**/*.tsx'))) + \
                       len(list(repo.glob('**/*.jsx')))
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement pre-scan file/line count estimation with cost projection and user confirmation.
2. Add configurable cost budgets per scan (`SECUREVIBES_MAX_COST_USD`).
3. Implement rate limiting on API requests.
4. Add circuit breaker pattern that pauses scans exceeding cost thresholds.
5. Provide real-time cost alerts at $1, $5, $10 milestones.
6. Implement intelligent file filtering to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, vendor directories.
7. Add --max-files and --max-file-size flags.

---

### 8. Malicious Files Could Cause JSON Parser Vulnerabilities or Resource Exhaustion [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:369`  
**CWE:** CWE-409  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

JSON parsing of agent-generated artifacts lacks protection against maliciously crafted payloads. The standard json.load() is used without size limits, nesting depth limits, or timeout mechanisms. Extremely large JSON files (multi-GB), deeply nested structures (10,000+ levels), or circular references could cause parser hangs, memory exhaustion, or crashes. While agents generate files, compromised agents or manual tampering could inject malicious JSON.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
            try:
                with open(results_file) as f:
                    results_data = json.load(f)
                
                issues_data = results_data.get("issues") or results_data.get("vulnerabilities")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement max `JSON` file size limit (10MB) with rejection of larger files.
2. Add max nesting depth validation (limit to 50 levels).
3. Use streaming `JSON` parser for large files.
4. Implement timeout mechanisms on `JSON` parsing operations (30 second limit).
5. Add schema validation with maximum array/object size constraints.
6. Implement resource monitoring killing parser if memory exceeds threshold.
7. Add pre-parse file size checks.

---

### 9. Error Messages and Stack Traces Leak Sensitive Information [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/cli/main.py:158`  
**CWE:** CWE-209  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

Exception handling throughout the codebase prints detailed error messages and stack traces that may expose absolute file paths, internal architecture details, and configuration values. The CLI --debug flag enables verbose output including full exception tracebacks. Error messages are displayed to console and may be logged or shared in bug reports, creating information disclosure vectors.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    except Exception as e:
        console.print(f"\n[bold red]❌ Error:[/bold red] {e}", style="red")
        if not quiet:
            console.print("\n[dim]Run with --help for usage information[/dim]")
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement sanitized error messages for production use, hiding technical details.
2. Log full stack traces to secure audit log only, not console.
3. Add --debug flag requirement for verbose error output.
4. Redact absolute paths, replacing with relative paths.
5. Implement error code system returning codes instead of descriptions.
6. Filter sensitive strings (API keys, tokens) from all error output.

### 10. No Audit Logging Prevents Forensic Analysis of Security Scan Activities [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:72`  
**CWE:** CWE-778  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

The system has no structured audit logging recording scan activities. ProgressTracker provides ephemeral console output but creates no persistent audit trail. No logs capture: who performed scans, what files were accessed, what data was transmitted to the API, or what configuration was used. This prevents forensic investigation after security incidents and allows users to deny scan activities.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    def on_tool_start(self, tool_name: str, tool_input: dict):
        """Called when a tool execution begins"""
        self.tool_count += 1
        self.last_update = datetime.now()
        
        # Show meaningful progress based on tool type
        if tool_name == "Read":
            file_path = tool_input.get("file_path", "")
            if file_path:
                self.files_read.add(file_path)
                filename = Path(file_path).name
                self.console.print(f"  📖 Reading {filename}", style="dim")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement structured audit logging to ~/`.securevibes/audit.log` with: timestamp, user, repository path, model used, cost incurred, files accessed, scan duration.
2. Log all Read/Write operations with full file paths.
3. Log API requests with request/response metadata.
4. Implement tamper-evident logging using append-only files with `HMAC` signatures.
5. Support centralized logging (syslog) for enterprise.
6. Add log rotation with retention policies.

### 11. Configuration Environment Variables Allow Bypassing Security Controls [🟢 LOW]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/config.py:66`  
**CWE:** CWE-15  
**Severity:** 🟢 Low

**Description:**

Environment variables (SECUREVIBES_MAX_TURNS, SECUREVIBES_*_MODEL) can be manipulated to change system behavior without validation. Setting MAX_TURNS to extreme values (999999) removes termination limits. No bounds checking ensures environment variables contain safe values. Integer parsing has try/except but defaults to standard value rather than failing securely on manipulation attempts.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    @classmethod
    def get_max_turns(cls) -> int:
        try:
            return int(os.getenv("SECUREVIBES_MAX_TURNS", cls.DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS))
        except ValueError:
            # If invalid value provided, return default
            return cls.DEFAULT_MAX_TURNS
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement strict validation on all environment variables with sane defaults.
2. Add maximum bounds on `SECUREVIBES_MAX_TURNS` (max: 200).
3. Whitelist valid model names rejecting arbitrary values.
4. Add warning when non-default configurations are detected.
5. Provide config file alternative with permission checks.
6. Document secure configuration practices.

---

### 12. Debug Mode Exposes Sensitive File Paths and Internal Operations [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:181`  
**CWE:** CWE-532  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

When --debug flag is enabled, ProgressTracker outputs verbose diagnostic information including full file paths (potentially containing usernames), search patterns revealing security focus areas, and internal agent narration. This information leakage could assist attackers in reconnaissance. Debug output shows agent reasoning and tool usage patterns that could be exploited.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    def on_assistant_text(self, text: str):
        """Called when the assistant produces text output"""
        if self.debug and text.strip():
            # Show agent narration in debug mode
            text_preview = text[:120].replace('\n', ' ')
            if len(text) > 120:
                text_preview += "..."
            self.console.print(f"  💭 {text_preview}", style="dim italic")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Sanitize all output in debug mode removing absolute paths (use relative paths only).
2. Implement redaction of usernames from file paths.
3. Add warning banner when --debug is enabled about sensitive information exposure.
4. Provide separate --trace flag for truly verbose output requiring explicit acknowledgment.
5. Automatically redact API keys and credentials from all output.

---

### 13. Concurrent Scans Overwrite Each Other's Results Causing Data Loss [🟢 LOW]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:242`  
**CWE:** CWE-362  
**Severity:** 🟢 Low

**Description:**

No file locking or concurrent access control prevents multiple scans from running simultaneously in the same repository. Concurrent scans overwrite .securevibes/ artifacts with last-write-wins semantics, causing data loss, corrupted reports, and race conditions. Users may receive mixed results from multiple scans.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        securevibes_dir = repo / SECUREVIBES_DIR
        try:
            securevibes_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
            raise RuntimeError(f"Failed to create output directory {securevibes_dir}: {e}")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement file-based locking (.securevibes/.lock file) preventing concurrent scans.
2. Use unique output directories per scan: .securevibes/scan-<timestamp>-<uuid>/.
3. Add --output-dir flag allowing user-specified isolated output paths.
4. Check for active scans before starting new scan, requiring --force to override.

---

### 14. Race Condition in Artifact File Writing Could Cause Partial/Corrupted Output [🟢 LOW]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/reporters/json_reporter.py:24`  
**CWE:** CWE-667  
**Severity:** 🟢 Low

**Description:**

Agents write artifacts using standard file operations without atomic write guarantees (write to temp + rename). If system crashes, process is killed, or disk fills during write, artifacts may be partially written. Subsequent agents reading corrupted JSON/Markdown fail or produce nonsensical results. No verification ensures file write completion.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(result.to_dict(), f, indent=2)
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement atomic writes: write to .tmp file then rename on success.
2. Add write verification reading back file and validating completeness.
3. Include file checksums in artifacts validating integrity before downstream use.
4. Implement file locking during write.
5. Add size validation checking file is reasonable before considering complete.

---

### 15. Hardcoded Secrets in Scanned Code Are Not Redacted from Reports [🟠 HIGH]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/reporters/markdown_reporter.py:186`  
**CWE:** CWE-312  
**Severity:** 🟠 High

**Description:**

When code snippets containing hardcoded credentials (API keys, passwords, tokens) are included in vulnerability reports, these secrets are written to plaintext files (VULNERABILITIES.json, scan_results.json, scan_report.md) without redaction. No automatic secret detection or sanitization occurs. Reports may be shared via email or Slack, spreading secrets further. Markdown reporter includes full code snippets in output without filtering.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
                if issue.code_snippet:
                    lines.append("**Code Snippet:**")
                    lines.append("")
                    # Try to detect language from file extension
                    file_ext = Path(issue.file_path).suffix.lstrip('.')
                    lang_map = {
                        'py': 'python',
                        'js': 'javascript',
                        ...
                    }
                    lang = lang_map.get(file_ext, '')
                    
                    lines.append(f"```{lang}")
                    lines.append(issue.code_snippet)
                    lines.append("```")
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Integrate secret detection (detect-secrets, TruffleHog) in pre-scan phase.
2. Implement automatic redaction in code snippets replacing detected secrets with '[`REDACTED`]'.
3. Add post-processing sanitization of all report outputs.
4. Add warning banner in reports: 'Review for hardcoded credentials before sharing'.
5. Provide --redact-secrets flag forcing sanitization.
6. Implement entropy-based detection identifying high-entropy strings.

### 16. Binary File Processing Causes Memory Exhaustion or Parser Crashes [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py:249`  
**CWE:** CWE-400  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

File processing lacks validation preventing agents from reading large binary files (images, videos, compiled binaries). The Read tool has no file type validation or size limits. Loading multi-gigabyte binary files into memory causes memory exhaustion (OOM) or excessive API costs transmitting non-code data. File counting at scanner.py:249-252 only filters by extension but agents can still read any file.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        # Count files for reporting
        files_scanned = len(list(repo.glob('**/*.py'))) + len(list(repo.glob('**/*.ts'))) + \
                       len(list(repo.glob('**/*.js'))) + len(list(repo.glob('**/*.tsx'))) + \
                       len(list(repo.glob('**/*.jsx')))
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement file type validation using magic number detection rejecting non-text files.
2. Add maximum file size limit (10MB per file).
3. Implement streaming/chunked reading for large files.
4. Add binary file detection skipping non-`UTF8` content.
5. Provide file type whitelist.
6. Add --max-file-size flag.
7. Implement memory monitoring pausing scans if memory usage exceeds threshold.

### 17. No Report Signing Allows Forgery of Security Assessment Results [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/reporters/json_reporter.py:24`  
**CWE:** CWE-345  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

Generated reports (scan_results.json, scan_report.md) lack digital signatures or cryptographic verification. An attacker can create forged reports claiming a codebase is secure when it contains critical vulnerabilities. Organizations making security decisions based on unsigned reports have no proof of authenticity. Reports can be fabricated without performing actual scans.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(result.to_dict(), f, indent=2)
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement GPG/PGP signing of all generated reports.
2. Include scan metadata in signature: timestamp, repository hash, scanner version.
3. Add verification command: 'securevibes verify scan_results.json'.
4. Include scan session `UUID` linking all artifacts.
5. Add visual verification indicators in reports.
6. Support enterprise CA integration for HSM-backed signing.

### 18. No Privilege Separation Between AI Agents Allows Cascade Failures [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/agents/definitions.py:11`  
**CWE:** CWE-250  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

All four AI agents (assessment, threat-modeling, code-review, report-generator) share identical permissions with no role-based access control. All agents have Read, Write, Grep, and Glob tool access. A compromise of any single agent grants full system access. Agents trust previous agents' output implicitly without validation, so compromising the Assessment agent poisons all downstream analysis.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
SECUREVIBES_AGENTS = {
    "assessment": AgentDefinition(
        tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "LS", "Write"],
    ),
    "threat-modeling": AgentDefinition(
        tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Write"],
    ),
    "code-review": AgentDefinition(
        tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Write"],
    ),
    "report-generator": AgentDefinition(
        tools=["Read", "Write"],
    )
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement principle of least privilege: Assessment agent only needs Read/Glob, Report Generator only needs Read.
2. Remove Write access from Code Review agent.
3. Implement agent-specific API credentials with usage quotas.
4. Add cross-validation: Code Review agent independently verifies architecture.
5. Implement multi-agent consensus for critical findings.
6. Add integrity checks where later agents validate checksums of earlier artifacts.

### 19. Prompt Injection Could Manipulate AI Agents to Execute Malicious Operations [🟡 MEDIUM]

**File:** `packages/core/securevibes/agents/definitions.py:11`  
**CWE:** CWE-94  
**Severity:** 🟡 Medium

**Description:**

AI agents receive untrusted input from repository files (README.md, comments, configuration files) which could contain prompt injection payloads. Maliciously crafted input could trick agents into executing unintended tool operations, ignoring security findings, or modifying scan logic. No validation prevents prompt injection attacks. Combined with bypassPermissions mode, this enables data exfiltration.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
    "assessment": AgentDefinition(
        description="Analyzes codebase architecture and creates comprehensive security documentation",
        prompt=AGENT_PROMPTS["assessment"],
        tools=["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "LS", "Write"],
        model=config.get_agent_model("assessment")
    )
```

**Recommendation:**

1. Implement prompt injection detection using known pattern signatures.
2. Sanitize all file inputs before including in agent prompts, escaping special characters.
3. Use structured prompt templating preventing injection in instruction sections.
4. Implement input validation rejecting files containing suspicious instruction phrases.
5. Add agent behavior monitoring detecting deviations from expected tool usage.
6. Use Claude's `system` prompt separation preventing user input from overriding instructions.
