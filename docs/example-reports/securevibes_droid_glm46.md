🔐 SecureVibes Security Review Report

   Executive Summary

   SecureVibes is an AI-native security scanning tool that demonstrates good security practices in several areas but contains critical vulnerabilities
   that require immediate attention. The review identified 7 security issues ranging from critical to low severity, with the most concerning being
   permission bypass capabilities and unencrypted data transmission.

   🔴 Critical Vulnerabilities

   1. Permission Bypass Mode - CRITICAL

   Location: securevibes/scanner/scanner.py

   python
     permission_mode='bypassPermissions'

   Risk: Allows Claude agents to bypass all file system and system access controls, potentially enabling unauthorized access to sensitive files and
   system resources.

   Impact: Complete system compromise if agents are malicious or compromised.

   Recommendation:

   python
     # Replace with least-privilege approach
     permission_mode='restricted'  # or implement scoped permissions

   🟠 High Severity Issues

   2. Unencrypted Data Transmission - HIGH

   Risk: User source code transmitted to Anthropic API without explicit encryption layer.

   Impact: Sensitive code could be intercepted during transmission.

   Recommendation:
   •  Implement TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   •  Add end-to-end encryption for sensitive code data
   •  Consider local processing option from highly sensitive codebases

   3. Test Fixture Hardcoded Secrets - HIGH

   Location: tests/fixtures/vulnerable_code.py

   python
     API_KEY = "test-fake-key-1234567890abcdef"
     SECRET_TOKEN = "test-fake-token-xxxxxxxxxxxxx"

   Risk: Hardcoded credentials in test files could be mistaken for real secrets or accidentally deployed.

   Recommendation:

   python
     # Use environment variables
     API_KEY = os.getenv('TEST_API_KEY', 'default-test-key')
     SECRET_TOKEN = os.getenv('TEST_SECRET_TOKEN', 'default-test-token')

   🟡 Medium Severity Issues

   4. Information Disclosure in Debug Mode - MEDIUM

   Location: securevibes/scanner/scanner.py

   python
     if self.debug:
         self.console.print(f"  💭 {text_preview}", style="dim italic")

   Risk: Verbose debug output may leak sensitive repository information, file paths, and internal system details.

   Recommendation:
   •  Sanitize debug output to remove sensitive paths
   •  Implement debug-level logging controls
   •  Add option to restrict debug output to local files only

   5. Error Message Information Leakage - MEDIUM

   Location: securevibes/cli/main.py

   python
     console.print(f"[bold red]❌ Error reading output file:[/bold red] {e}")

   Risk: Error messages reveal system architecture and file structure.

   Recommendation:

   python
     # Use generic error messages for user-facing output
     console.print("[bold red]❌ Error accessing output file.[/bold red]")

   ──────────────────────────────────────────

   🟢 Low Severity Issues

   6. Log File Information Leakage - LOW

   Risk: Log files may contain sensitive scan results and vulnerability details.

   Recommendation:
   •  Implement log sanitization
   •  Add secure log rotation with restricted permissions
   •  Consider encrypting log files contain
