Security Review Complete

  I've performed a comprehensive security review of the SecureVibes codebase. Here are my findings:

  Executive Summary

  The codebase contains 9 confirmed security vulnerabilities across critical, high, and medium severity levels. SecureVibes is a security analysis tool that uses
  Claude AI agents to scan code repositories, which creates unique security challenges around agent permissions, data transmission, and output validation.

  Critical Issues (2)

  1. Unrestricted Filesystem Access

  Location: scanner.py:298Severity: CRITICAL

  The scanner uses permission_mode='bypassPermissions', granting agents unrestricted filesystem access without any path validation:

  options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
      agents=agents,
      cwd=str(repo),
      max_turns=config.get_max_turns(),
      permission_mode='bypassPermissions',  # ‚Üê No restrictions!

  The pre_tool_hook (lines 263-268) only tracks operations but performs NO validation. Agents can read sensitive files like ~/.ssh/id_rsa, /etc/passwd, or write
  to system files.

  Recommendation:
  - Change to permission_mode='requirePermissions' or 'acceptEdits'
  - Implement path validation in pre_tool_hook to restrict operations to repository directory
  - Use os.path.realpath() to resolve paths and verify they're within allowed boundaries
  - Reject paths containing ../ or absolute paths outside working directory

  ---
  2. Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

  Location: pyproject.toml:28-34Severity: CRITICAL

  All dependencies use >= operator without upper bounds or hash verification:

  dependencies = [
      "claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0",
      "anyio>=4.0.0",
      "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
      "click>=8.0.0",
      "rich>=13.0.0",
  ]

  This allows automatic installation of any future version, including potentially compromised releases.

  Recommendation:
  - Pin exact versions: claude-agent-sdk==0.1.2
  - Create requirements.txt with hashed dependencies (pip freeze --require-hashes)
  - Add upper bounds: claude-agent-sdk>=0.1.0,<0.2.0
  - Implement dependency verification in CI/CD using pip-audit or safety

  High Severity Issues (3)

  3. Missing JSON Schema Validation

  Location: scanner.py:373, 424Severity: HIGH

  Agent-generated JSON files are loaded without any validation:

  with open(results_file) as f:
      results_data = json.load(f)  # No validation, size limits, or schema enforcement

  Vulnerable to JSON bombs (deeply nested objects), malicious content, or excessively large strings.

  Recommendation:
  - Implement jsonschema library validation with strict schemas
  - Set maximum file size limits (e.g., 10MB) before loading
  - Implement depth limits for nested objects (max_depth=10)
  - Add timeout limits for JSON parsing operations

  ---
  4. No Tool Parameter Validation

  Location: scanner.py:263-268Severity: HIGH

  Tool parameters (file paths, patterns) are not validated before execution:

  async def pre_tool_hook(input_data: dict, tool_use_id: str, ctx: dict) -> dict:
      tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name")
      tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
      tracker.on_tool_start(tool_name, tool_input)
      return {}  # No validation performed!

  This allows path traversal via ../ sequences and access to any file.

  Recommendation:
  - Implement parameter validation in pre_tool_hook
  - For Write tool: validate file_path is within .securevibes/ directory
  - For Read tool: validate file_path is within repository directory
  - Return error from hook to prevent tool execution if validation fails

  5. XSS in Markdown Reports

  Location: markdown_reporter.py:150, 168, 181, 215Severity: HIGH

  Only escapes pipe characters for table formatting, no HTML entity encoding:

  # Line 150 - Only escapes pipes
  title = title.replace("|", "\\|")

  # Lines 168, 181, 215 - Direct insertion without HTML escaping
  lines.append(f"### {idx}. {issue.title} [{icon} {issue.severity.value.upper()}]")
  lines.append(issue.description)
  lines.append(MarkdownReporter._format_recommendation(issue.recommendation))

  When viewed in markdown renderers that support HTML (GitHub, GitLab), malicious content like <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> could execute JavaScript.

  Recommendation:
  - Implement HTML entity encoding for all agent-provided content
  - Strip or escape HTML tags: < > & " ' ‚Üí &lt; &gt; &amp; &quot; &#x27;
  - Use markdown sanitization library like bleach
  - Validate that code snippets only contain expected characters

  ---
  Medium Severity Issues (4)

  6. No Audit Logging

  Location: scanner.py:181-186Severity: MEDIUM

  No persistent audit trail of agent actions - only ephemeral console output:

  if self.debug and text.strip():
      text_preview = text[:120].replace('\n', ' ')
      if len(text) > 120:
          text_preview += "..."
      self.console.print(f"  üí≠ {text_preview}", style="dim italic")

  Recommendation:
  - Implement structured audit logging to .securevibes/audit.log
  - Log all Read/Write/Grep/Glob operations with timestamps and paths
  - Make audit log append-only with HMAC signatures for tamper-evidence

  ---
  7. Missing Cost Controls

  Location: scanner.py:330Severity: MEDIUM

  Cost is tracked but not enforced:

  if message.total_cost_usd:
      self.total_cost = message.total_cost_usd  # Only for display, no enforcement

  Recommendation:
  - Implement --max-cost flag to set hard budget limit
  - Add cost checking logic that aborts scan when threshold exceeded
  - Show cost estimate before scan and require confirmation if > $1.00

  ---
  8. No File Size Limits

  Location: scanner.py:298Severity: MEDIUM

  Read tool loads entire files into memory without size validation. Could cause memory exhaustion with large files.

  Recommendation:
  - Implement maximum file size limits (e.g., 50MB default, configurable)
  - Add file size check before reading: if file.stat().st_size > MAX_SIZE: reject
  - Skip binary files and known large extensions

  ---
  9. Model Downgrade via Environment Variables

  Location: config.py:57-59Severity: MEDIUM

  Environment variables override model selection without warning:

  env_var = f"SECUREVIBES_{agent_name.upper()}_MODEL"
  env_value = os.getenv(env_var)
  if env_value:
      return env_value  # No validation or warning

  An attacker who can set environment variables could force weaker models for security-critical agents.

  Recommendation:
  - Add warning when environment variables override CLI settings
  - Implement minimum model capability requirements with validation
  - Log all model selection decisions with source to audit log

  ---
  Additional Observations

  Positive Security Practices:
  - Error handling includes proper exception types (OSError, PermissionError, json.JSONDecodeError)
  - Uses Path objects for filesystem operations
  - Console output sanitization in CLI (though not complete)

  No Malicious Code Detected:
  All issues are defensive security concerns requiring hardening, not offensive vulnerabilities.
