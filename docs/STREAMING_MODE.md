# Streaming Mode - Real-Time Progress Tracking

## Overview

SecureVibes supports **real-time streaming progress** mode for security scans. This eliminates long silent periods during scans (10-20+ minutes) and provides continuous feedback about what the scanner is doing.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
securevibes scan .              # Real-time progress (always enabled)
securevibes scan . --debug      # + Agent narration/thinking
```

## Problem It Solves

Traditional security scans can take 10-20+ minutes on large codebases with minimal progress feedback. Users would see:

```
━━━ Phase 3/4: Code Review (Security Analysis) ━━━
  ⏳ Analyzing... (20 tools used)
[10 minutes of silence]
  ⏳ Analyzing... (30 tools used)
```

This led to:
- Uncertainty about scan progress
- Unclear if scanner is stuck or working
- Poor user experience during long operations
- No visibility into what files/patterns are being analyzed

## Solution: Real-Time Progress Tracking

SecureVibes uses the Claude Agent SDK's **hooks system** to provide real-time updates on:

✅ **Tool Usage** - See every Read, Grep, Write operation as it happens  
✅ **File Operations** - Know which files are being analyzed  
✅ **Sub-Agent Lifecycle** - Deterministic phase start/stop events  
✅ **Cost Tracking** - Real-time cost accumulation  
✅ **Agent Narration** - Optional debug mode shows agent thinking

## Usage

Real-time progress is always enabled. Use the `--debug` flag for verbose output:

```bash
# Basic scan with real-time progress
securevibes scan .

# Verbose debug output (shows agent narration)
securevibes scan . --debug

# Scan specific directory
securevibes scan /path/to/large/repo
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture

Streaming mode uses `ClaudeSDKClient` with three key hooks:

1. **PreToolUse** - Fires before each tool execution
   - Shows file reads, searches, writes in real-time
   - Detects sub-agent orchestration

2. **PostToolUse** - Fires after each tool completes
   - Reports tool failures with error messages
   - Tracks success/failure rates

3. **SubagentStop** - Fires when sub-agent completes
   - Provides deterministic phase boundaries
   - Reports duration, tool count, file operations
   - Eliminates need for file polling

### Progress Tracking

The `ProgressTracker` class maintains:
- Current phase context
- Tool usage counter
- Set of files read/written
- Sub-agent call stack
- Phase timing information

### Performance Impact

Streaming mode has minimal performance overhead:
- ~2-5% additional latency from hook processing
- Minimal API cost overhead
- Slightly higher memory for progress tracking (~1-2 MB)

### Debug Mode

Add `--debug` flag for maximum verbosity:

```bash
securevibes scan . --debug
```

This shows:
- Agent narration (thinking process)
- Real-time cost updates
- Detailed error messages
- Hook execution traces

## When Progress Tracking Helps Most

### Especially Useful For:
✅ Large codebases (1000+ files)  
✅ Long-running scans (>5 minutes)  
✅ Production security audits  
✅ CI/CD pipelines (progress visibility)  
✅ Debugging or monitoring scans  
✅ Understanding what the scanner is analyzing

### Output Control:
- Use `--quiet` for minimal output
- Use `--debug` for maximum verbosity with agent narration
- Use `--format json` for machine-readable output

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

Streaming mode migrates from the simple `query()` API to `ClaudeSDKClient` with hooks for real-time event capture.

**Key Components:**

1. **Scanner Class** (`packages/core/securevibes/scanner/scanner.py`)
   - Uses `ClaudeSDKClient` with hooks for real-time events
   - Implements three hooks for complete visibility
   - Returns `ScanResult` with all vulnerability findings
   - Compatible with all existing agent definitions

2. **ProgressTracker Class**
   - Tracks tool usage, files read/written, sub-agent stack
   - Smart output formatting with emojis and colors
   - Phase timing and statistics
   - Debug mode for agent narration

3. **Hook System** (Closures)

```python
# PreToolUse - Fires before any tool executes
async def pre_tool_hook(input_data: dict, tool_use_id: str, ctx: dict):
    tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name")
    tool_input = input_data.get("tool_input", {})
    tracker.on_tool_start(tool_name, tool_input)
    return {}

# PostToolUse - Fires after tool completes
async def post_tool_hook(input_data: dict, tool_use_id: str, ctx: dict):
    tool_name = input_data.get("tool_name")
    is_error = input_data.get("tool_response", {}).get("is_error", False)
    tracker.on_tool_complete(tool_name, not is_error)
    return {}

# SubagentStop - DETERMINISTIC phase completion marker
async def subagent_hook(input_data: dict, tool_use_id: str, ctx: dict):
    agent_name = input_data.get("agent_name")
    duration_ms = input_data.get("duration_ms", 0)
    tracker.on_subagent_stop(agent_name, duration_ms)
    return {}
```

**Why Closures?** Hooks are defined as closures inside `scan()` method to capture the `tracker` instance. This avoids needing a `hook_context` parameter (which isn't supported by the SDK).
